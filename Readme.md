# This is for clarity of project what we are about to do.

Let's analyze your Leaderboard Task step-by-step and break it down into implementation-ready components.

âœ… Project Objective Summary
Create a full-stack leaderboard app:

Frontend (ReactJS): Show a list of users, claim points for selected user, and show leaderboard.

Backend (NodeJS + MongoDB): Store users, handle point claims with history, and calculate rankings dynamically.

âœ… Functional Requirements Breakdown
ðŸ“¦ Backend (NodeJS + MongoDB)
1. User Collection
MongoDB collection with at least 10 users initially.

Schema:

js
Copy code
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  totalPoints: Number
}
2. Claim Points Logic
API to handle point claims.

Randomly generate points between 1-10.

Update the user's totalPoints.

Log the claim in a separate collection.

3. History Collection
Schema:

js
Copy code
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  claimedPoints: Number,
  timestamp: Date
}
4. Leaderboard Ranking
Sort users in descending order by totalPoints.

Calculate and return rank with each response.

5. Real-Time Updates
Endpoint should return up-to-date rankings after each claim.

Optionally use WebSocket or polling for real-time UI updates.

ðŸŽ¨ Frontend (ReactJS)
1. User Selection List
Display a dropdown or list of 10 users.

Option to add new users.

2. Claim Button
Next to each user.

On click, call claim_point API.

Show awarded points immediately.

3. Leaderboard Component
Dynamically display:

Name

Total Points

Rank

Auto-refresh on every claim.

ðŸ”§ System Architecture Flow
ReactJS fetches and displays 10 users.

User clicks Claim.

ReactJS sends userId to /claim-points endpoint.

Backend:

Generates random points.

Updates userâ€™s totalPoints.

Logs in history collection.

Returns updated leaderboard.

ReactJS updates the leaderboard on screen.

âœ… Non-Functional + Bonus Requirements
Clean modern UI (MaterialUI or Tailwind CSS recommended)

Responsive layout (flex/grid)

Pagination logic (if users > 10 in future)

Reusable components

Minimal, meaningful code comments
